If you would like a calendar invitation to one of these calls, please get in touch by writing an email to rcintra@igalia.com or fill the [contact form](https://forms.gle/rSNWHknikVSpGHmD6).

The role of these calls within TC39 process:
- Input on direction/priorities
- Feedback on Stage 2 or earlier proposals
- Distribute information about TC39, Stage 3+ proposals, etc
- Expose opportunities to get involved (in GitHub, docs, etc)
- Not a consensus-seeking group, just a data source
